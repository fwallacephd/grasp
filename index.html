                <p class="content text-center">GRASP was founded by Dr. Julie Rubinacci and Dr. Faith Wallace, two reading specialists with expertise in assessment and diagonstics of readers, K-12. Through GRASP, they work with students of all ages and abilities to understand their individual reading needs and create a report of their findings with recommendations for instruction that parents can use as a basis for hiring tutors or take to school for parent-teacher conferences. Drs. Ruby and Wallace do offer tutoring services on a limited basis.</p>

                <p class="blockquote"> At GRASP, we take a student-centered approach to understanding individual learning needs. Our philosophy guides us to watch and listen carefully to students as they read and write during authentic tasks and discuss their motivation and goals for becoming successful readers. Student strengths in literacy is just as important as their weaknesses when we analyze data and build recommendations that meet each individual student’s needs. These recommendations may include work with magnetic letters if we find gaps in phonics knowledge; learning Latin and Greek elements to unlock advanced vocabulary; using graphic organizers to enhance comprehension. In addition, we provide a highly individualized book recommendation list for each student. Our detailed reports and final conference provide parents with the tool they need to suppliment instruction, hire a tutor, or talk to their child's teacher.

                <p class="blockquote"> Drs. Ruby and Wallace met during their doctoral program back in 2000 at Georgia State University. There, they specialized in langauge and literacy acquisition, specifically focusing on assessment of individual learners, K -12. After their doctoral program, both Drs. Ruby and Wallace went on to become Professors of Reading and taught future reading teachers best practices in reading assessment and instruction. Now, they are pooling their knowledge and embarking on a new endeaver, to work directly with the students of Georiga to assess their individual learning needs and advocate for their instruction. Their approach is wholeistic — looking to understand the balance of students' strengths and weaknesses in order to devise an individual plan of recommendations to support student learning in reading instruciton. </p>

We start with a reading interview to understand reading preferences, strategies for choosing books, and goals as a reader. Then, we use leveled-word lists and passages to determine individual strengths and weaknesses in the following categories: phonemic awareness and phonics (when applicable), word recognition, comprehension, fluency, and vocabulary. A detailed report of our findings, recommendations for instruciton and follow-up conference is included.</p>
